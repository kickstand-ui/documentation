# Images

The Kickstand UI image component comes with a number of added features to help improve your page load times as well as the user experience once it is loaded.

The default component looks and feels a lot like a normal `img` element. You use the `src` and `alt` attributes just as you normally would.

<div class="my-xl text-center">
    <ks-img
        src="/images/demo/michael_scott_jesus.jpg"
        alt="Michael Scott Jesus"
        class="w-50 mx-auto"
        />
</div>

```html
<ks-img src="/images/demo/michael_scott_jesus.jpg" alt="Michael Scott"></ks-img>
```

## Fallback Image

If the image specified in the `src` attribute fails for any reason, you can specify a fallback or default image using the `fallback-src` attribute.

<div class="my-xl text-center">
    <ks-img
        src="/nonexistent-image.jpg"
        fallback-src="/images/demo/100-percent-Michael-Scott.png"
        alt="Michael Scott"
        class="w-50 mx-auto"
        lazy
        />
</div>

```html
<ks-img
    src="/nonexistent-image.jpg"
    fallback-src="/images/demo/100-percent-Michael-Scott.png"
    alt="Michael Scott"
    lazy
    />
```

## Lazy-Loading

A great performance feature is the ability to lazy-load off-screen images and control when they get loaded. This example is above the fold so it will load right away because it is already in the view-port, but the images farther down the page will be lazy-loaded.

<div class="my-xl text-center">
    <ks-img
        src="/images/demo/superstitious.jpg"
        alt="Michael Scott"
        class="w-50 mx-auto"
        aspect-ratio="1.5:1"
        lazy
        />
</div>

```html
<ks-img src="/images/demo/superstitious.jpg" alt="Michael Scott" lazy></ks-img>
```

## Height and Width

You can explicitly specify the width and height on an image using the `height` and `width` properties. This will improve page performance as it reduces content shifting as it will pre-allocate the space on the page for the image.

```html
<ks-img src="/images/demo/superstitious.jpg" height="300" width="500"></ks-img>
```

## Aspect Ratio

Sometimes you don't always know what the height and width will be on an image depending on the screen size or because the content is dynamically generated. In these cases, it is better to specify an aspect ratio and Kickstand UI will auto-generate the height and the width on the fly for you. This is especially important if you are lazy-loading images because the browser does not know how to calculate how much space the image will occupy until the image is downloaded and rendered.

<div class="my-xl text-center">
    <ks-img
        src="/images/demo/michael_scott.jpg"
        alt="Michael Scott"
        class="w-50 mx-auto"
        aspect-ratio="3:2"
        lazy
        />
</div>

```html
<ks-img aspect-ratio="3:2"></ks-img>
```
